# 🧭 Customer Journey Analysis & Recommendations

## 🔎 Short Summary

Your flow **mostly makes sense**, but right now the journey is:

* Visually premium ✅
* Emotionally reassuring ✅
* Logically implied ❗
* Explicitly explained ❌

The main issue:
The **real operational journey** (EOI → Hospital Questionnaire → Wait for quote → Return with reference → Travel booking) is not clearly narrated as a single, cohesive path across all pages.

You need:

1. One **master narrative**
2. Clear separation between **Medical (hospital)** and **Travel (you)**
3. Repeated reinforcement of "What happens next"

---

# 🧭 1. The Actual Customer Journey (Clarity Check)

This is your real backend journey:

| Stage | Who Handles It  | What Happens                       |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1     | User → You      | Submit EOI / Interest Form         |
| 2     | User → Hospital | Complete Health Questionnaire      |
| 3     | Hospital → User | Medical assessment + surgery quote |
| 4     | User → You      | Return with hospital reference     |
| 5     | You             | Organise flights + group travel    |
| 6     | Group Travel    | Surgery trip                       |

This is good. Clean. Ethical. Legally safe.

The issue is:
👉 The website currently makes it *feel* like booking happens sooner than it actually does.

---

# 🧠 2. Homepage Review (Emotional vs Logical Alignment)

### Hero Section

"Start Health Questionnaire" is strong — but slightly misleading.

Because:

* The questionnaire is not yours
* It is the hospital's
* It happens after EOI

**Recommendation:**
Rename primary CTA to:

* "Begin Medical Assessment"
  OR
* "Express Interest"

Then inside the next page explain the sequence.

---

### How It Works Section (On Homepage)

Right now it visually explains steps — but not clearly enough.

You need a **5-Step Snapshot** right on homepage:

> 1️⃣ Express Interest
> 2️⃣ Complete Hospital Assessment
> 3️⃣ Receive Medical Quote
> 4️⃣ Confirm & Return to Us
> 5️⃣ We Organise Travel

Luxury brands remove uncertainty.
You currently have elegance — but not enough operational clarity.

---

# 🏥 3. "How It Works" Page Review

This page is good structurally, but it needs stronger sequencing language.

For example:

### Step 1: Your Details

Clear. Good.

### Step 2: Hospital Assessment

Good — but it must say clearly:

> "This is handled directly by the hospital. Compass Connect does not access or store medical data."

You imply this — but it needs to feel protective and intentional.

---

### Missing Step

Right now the critical step is under-communicated:

> After you receive your hospital quote, return to Compass Connect using your reference number.

That needs to be a bold, highlighted stage.

You should visually separate:

🟢 MEDICAL PHASE
🔵 TRAVEL PHASE

Because those are two distinct journeys.

---

# ✈️ 4. Travel Groups Page

This page is strong visually.

But psychologically:
It feels like users can "reserve" immediately.

In reality:
They should only reserve once medically cleared.

So:

If medically cleared → show Reserve button
If not cleared → button should say:

> "Start Medical Assessment First"

Otherwise users may misunderstand timing.

---

# 📝 5. Express Interest Page (EOI Form)

This page is actually one of your strongest.

But you are missing expectation setting.

Above the form you should clearly say:

### After submitting this form:

* You will receive a confirmation email
* You will complete the hospital health questionnaire
* The hospital will contact you directly
* Once approved, return to us with your reference

This removes anxiety.
Luxury = certainty.

---

# 📩 6. Email Flow (Critical)

Your confirmation email must include:

### Subject:

"Your Medical Assessment Journey Has Begun"

### Inside:

1. Thank you
2. Here is your next step: Complete hospital questionnaire
3. What happens after
4. Important: Once you receive your hospital reference number, return using this link

That link should:

* Pre-fill their data if possible
* Move them into Travel Coordination stage

Right now your flow exists — but it's not being explained enough.

---

# 🧱 7. Cohesion Audit (Messaging Consistency)

You use:

* Luxury
* Elite
* Concierge
* Excellence
* Spa-like
* Medical journey

These are consistent visually.

What needs consistency:
The **non-medical positioning**.

Every page should reinforce:

> We coordinate travel.
> The hospital provides medical care.

This protects you legally and builds trust.

---

# 🧩 8. What's Missing

### A Clear Journey Diagram Section

You need a single elegant visual like:

```
Interest → Hospital Assessment → Medical Approval → Travel Coordination → Group Departure
```

Minimal. Premium. Gold line connecting them.

This should appear:

* On homepage
* On How It Works
* In email

Repetition builds clarity.

---

# 🎯 9. Does It Flow Logically?

Yes — operationally.
No — narratively.

Right now the story is:

Luxury Concierge Experience ✨

But the real story is:

Clear Medical Path → Then Premium Travel Support

You need to explicitly bridge those.

---

# 🏗 Final Recommendation Structure

If I were refining this:

### Homepage Flow

1. Hero (Clear CTA: Begin Assessment)
2. 5-Step Journey Overview
3. Hospital Accreditation Section
4. Why Group Travel
5. Curated Excellence
6. Travel Groups Preview
7. CTA

---

### How It Works Page

Split into two columns:

**Phase 1: Medical Assessment**
Handled by hospital

**Phase 2: Travel Coordination**
Handled by Compass Connect

---

### Travel Groups Page

Add small text:

> Available to medically approved patients.

---

### EOI Page

Add:

"What Happens After You Submit"

---

# 🏁 Final Verdict

Your branding: 9/10
Your UI/UX: 8.5/10
Your legal separation: 8/10
Your narrative clarity: 6.5/10

Once you clarify sequencing and reinforce the two-phase journey everywhere, this becomes:

🔥 Extremely trustworthy
🔥 Emotionally safe
🔥 High-end
🔥 Legally clean

---

---

### **Step 4 — Return to Compass Connect**

Using your hospital reference, you return to us to:

---

### **Step 5 — Depart with Your Travel Group**

You travel with:

Travel logistics remain with us.

This separation must be repeated consistently.

---

# 2️⃣ Homepage: Replace "How It Works" With This Section

## ✨ Your Journey, Clearly Defined

Add a horizontal 5-step visual:

```
Interest → Medical Assessment → Medical Approval → Travel Coordination → Departure
```

Under it:

> A seamless, two-phase journey.
> Medical care handled by accredited professionals.
> Travel coordination handled by Compass Connect.

This removes confusion immediately.

---

# 3️⃣ Refined "How It Works" Page (Split Into Two Phases)

## PHASE ONE

### Medical Assessment (Handled by Hospital)

**1. Submit Interest**
We collect your basic travel details only.

**2. Complete Hospital Questionnaire**
Submitted directly on the hospital's secure platform.

**3. Medical Review**
Hospital sends you eligibility confirmation and quote.

Clear divider:

---

## PHASE TWO

### Travel Coordination (Handled by Compass Connect)

**4. Confirm with Reference Number**
Return to us once medically approved.

**5. Secure Travel & Group Placement**
We organise:

* Flights
* Airport transfers
* Departure coordination

Footer reinforcement:

> Compass Connect is an independent, non-medical concierge service.

Now your structure is legally and logically airtight.

---

# 4️⃣ Travel Groups Page Adjustment

Under each "Reserve" button add:

> Available to medically approved patients.

If someone is not approved:

Button changes to:
"Begin Medical Assessment"

This prevents premature booking.

---

# 5️⃣ EOI Page — Add This Section Above The Form

## What Happens After You Submit

After completing this form:

1. You'll receive a confirmation email.
2. You'll be directed to the hospital's secure health questionnaire.
3. The hospital reviews your medical suitability.
4. Once approved, you return to us to finalise travel arrangements.

Short. Clear. Confidence-building.

---
